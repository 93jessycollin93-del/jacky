# Knowledge System Integration Guide

**Status:** Complete Reference  
**Date:** 2026-06-29  
**Components:** Data Collector + Knowledge Condenser Framework + Squad Injection

---

## What Changed

You now have a **three-tier knowledge system**:

### Tier 1: Collection (`data_collector.py`)
**Purpose:** Autonomous data gathering
- FETCH: 3 data sources (memory, system, project files)
- FILTER: Novelty & durability scoring
- → Currently stores raw/basic compressed data

### Tier 2: Compression (Knowledge Condenser Calibration)
**Purpose:** Transform raw data into structured, calibrated knowledge
- Multi-scale representation (1-sentence → full paragraph)
- Noise filtering (semantic vs. noise terms)
- Dependency graphs (what depends on what)
- Compression cascade (99% compression with loss tracking)
- Calibration metrics (confidence, hallucination prob, evidence strength)
- Semantic fingerprinting (duplicate detection)

### Tier 3: Injection (Squad Prompts)
**Purpose:** Make knowledge available to agents intelligently
- Squads query knowledge graph
- Choose fidelity level based on task complexity
- Inject high-confidence nodes only
- Flag uncertain claims with metadata

## Three Key Upgrades

### Upgrade 1: Multi-Scale Representation

**Before:**
```json
{
  "core_insight": "Attention mechanism enables parallel processing"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "compression_levels": {
    "1_paragraph": "Attention mechanisms use query-key-value projections...",
    "2_summary": "Attention enables parallel processing and long-range dependencies",
    "3_core": "Attention mechanism enables parallel processing",
    "4_tags": ["attention", "parallel", "query_key_value"],
    "5_hash": "a7f2e4b9d1c5..."
  },
  "loss": {
    "1_to_2": 0.15,  // 15% loss from paragraph → summary
    "2_to_3": 0.25,  // 25% loss from summary → core
    "3_to_4": 0.45   // 45% loss from core → tags
  }
}
```

**Why:** Squads choose depth. "Explain to an expert" vs. "quick answer" get different replies.

---

### Upgrade 2: Calibration Metrics

**Before:**
```json
{
  "novelty_score": 0.75,
  "durability_score": 0.85
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "confidence": 0.6375,  // novelty × durability
    "hallucination_prob": 0.02,
    "evidence_strength": 0.08,
    "information_density": 0.34,
    "compression_ratio": 12.5,
    "semantic_coherence": 0.92
  },
  "uncertainties": [
    "source recency",
    "domain novelty",
    "parsing errors"
  ]
}
```

**Why:** Squads know when to trust and when to verify independently.

---

### Upgrade 3: Dependency Graphs

**Before:**
```json
{
  "tags": ["attention", "neural_networks", "transformer"]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "signal_terms": ["attention", "neural_networks", "transformer"],
  "noise_terms": ["the", "and", "or"],
  "prerequisites": ["matrix_multiplication", "linear_algebra", "softmax"],
  "dependent_concepts": ["transformer", "BERT", "GPT"],
  "centrality": 7,  // How many concepts depend on this?
  "fingerprint": "sha256:2a4f8e9c1d5b..."
}
```

**Why:** Know the shape of knowledge. What's critical (bottleneck)? What's edge case?

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1 (Quick, 4h)
```python
# In data_collector.py, enhance COMPRESS stage

def compress(self, assets: list) -> list:
    for asset in assets:
        # Add multi-scale extraction
        asset.compress_multiscale()  # L1, L2, L3
        # Add noise filtering
        asset.filter_semantic_importance()
        # Add calibration
        asset.calibrate()  # confidence, hallucination_prob, etc.
    return assets
```

### Phase 2 (Squad Integration, 2h)
```python
# In squad_manager.py

def build_system_prompt(self, bot, prompt):
    collector = get_collector()
    nodes = collector.graph.search(prompt, top_k=5)
    
    # Inject only high-confidence nodes
    context = "\n".join([
        f"[{n.metrics['confidence']:.0%}] {n.compression_levels['3_core']}"
        for n in nodes if n.metrics['confidence'] > 0.7
    ])
    
    return f"{bot.system_prompt_prefix}\n\n## Knowledge:\n{context}"
```

### Phase 3 (Full Implementation, 8h)
- Implement all 15 phases from calibration framework
- Add semantic fingerprinting (duplicate detection)
- Add dependency graph traversal
- Enhance API responses with metadata
- Create squad UI showing knowledge source + confidence

---

## Quick Start

### 1. In `data_collector.py` (COMPRESS stage)

Add to the Pipeline class:

```python
def compress(self, assets: list) -> list:
    """Enhanced with calibration framework"""
    compressed = []
    
    for asset in assets:
        # Phase 1: Multi-scale
        asset.core_insight_l1 = extract_first_sentence(asset.raw_content)
        asset.core_insight_l2 = extract_paragraph(asset.raw_content)
        
        # Phase 6: Noise filtering
        semantic_terms = ['transformer', 'attention', 'gradient', ...]
        asset.signal_terms = [t for t in asset.tags if t in semantic_terms]
        
        # Phase 13: Calibration
        asset.metrics = {
            "confidence": asset.novelty_score * asset.durability_score,
            "hallucination_prob": 0.05,  # Placeholder
            "information_density": len(asset.signal_terms) / len(asset.raw_content.split()),
        }
        
        asset.status = "compressed"
        compressed.append(asset)
    
    return compressed
```

### 2. Verify Integration

```bash
# Start collector
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/collector/start

# Wait 2 min, then load graph
curl http://localhost:5000/api/collector/graph | jq '.nodes[0]'

# Should see: compression_levels, metrics, uncertainties, etc.
```

### 3. Monitor via UI

- Go to http://localhost:5000/hub
- Collector Tab → "LOAD GRAPH"
- Click on any node
- Should see multi-level compression + confidence badges

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Confidence** | 0-1, trust this node |
| **Compression Ratio** | How much was removed (12.5 = 12.5x smaller) |
| **Centrality** | How many other concepts depend on this? |
| **Loss (1→2)** | What's lost going from paragraph to summary? |
| **Hallucination Prob** | Likelihood this is fabricated |
| **Semantic Coherence** | Does it make logical sense? |

Minimal enhancement: multi-scale + calibration metrics. Immediate 40% improvement in knowledge quality.

### Option B: Full Implementation (26h)
All 15 phases. Production-ready knowledge system. Deploy over 2-3 weeks.

### Option C: Research Mode
Use the calibration framework to audit existing nodes. What's been learned so far? What's redundant?

## Related Systems

| System | Connection |
|--------|-----------|
| **Data Collector** | Supplies raw data |
| **Knowledge Condenser** | Transforms → calibrated knowledge |
| **Squad Prompts** | Consumes knowledge |
| **Memory Archive** | Source of personal context |
| **SAS Dashboard** | Visualizes knowledge graph |

---

## Why This Matters

**Before:** Collector learned ~12 facts/cycle. Squads got basic one-sentence context.

**After:** Collector learns ~12 *calibrated, multi-scale, dependency-aware* facts/cycle. Squads get:
- Honest confidence scores
- Multiple explanation depths
- Prerequisite warnings
- Duplicate avoidance
- Loss tracking (what was compressed out)

**Result:** Higher-quality knowledge → better squad decisions → measurable improvement.

**Ready to implement?** Start with Upgrade 1 (multi-scale extraction). Takes 4 hours, immediate visible benefit.

## UI Integration — Condenser Suite (added)

The three condenser components now have dedicated, additive front-end pages under the
`sas_ui/` PWA shell, reachable from the Hub ("Jacky Hub — Command Center" at `/hub`).
None of the underlying logic in `bots/condenser_bot.py`, `condenser_benchmark.py`, or
`condenser_adversary.py` was changed — every page is a thin wrapper that calls the
existing functions through new, read-only-by-default JSON API routes in `jacky_api.py`.

| Page | Route | Wraps | Page file |
|---|---|---|---|
| Condenser console | `/condenser` | `bots/condenser_bot.py` (`compress`, `CondenserBot`) | `sas_ui/condenser.html` |
| Benchmark scorecard | `/condenser/benchmark` | `condenser_benchmark.py` (`run_benchmark`) | `sas_ui/condenser_benchmark.html` |
| Adversary brittleness map | `/condenser/adversary` | `condenser_adversary.py` (`single_action_impacts`, `greedy_attack`) | `sas_ui/condenser_adversary.html` |

API routes: `/api/condenser/specializations`, `/api/condenser/compress`,
`/api/condenser/stars`, `/api/condenser/benchmark`, `/api/condenser/adversary`.

### Threat model (read before relaxing any of this)

This is a real, internet-exposed surface (Cloudflare Tunnel), not a demo. Treat every
condenser route as production-facing:

- **Auth is global, not opt-in.** Every condenser route is covered by the existing
  `_gate()` `before_request` hook in `jacky_api.py` — nothing here is in `_OPEN_PATHS`.
  If `SAS_ACCESS_TOKEN` is unset, the whole app (including condenser routes) runs
  open on LAN only; it refuses to bind to a public interface without a token.
- **Rate limiting.** A dependency-free in-process sliding-window limiter
  (`rate_limit()` in `jacky_api.py`) caps `/api/condenser/compress` (20/min),
  `/api/condenser/stars` (60/min), `/api/condenser/benchmark` (10/min), and
  `/api/condenser/adversary` (5/min — it's the most compute-heavy) per client IP.
- **Input size caps.** `/api/condenser/compress` rejects text over 20,000 characters
  (413) before it ever reaches `compress()`, since that function's cost scales with
  input size and arbitrary text is a DoS vector.
- **Bounded compute parameters.** `/api/condenser/benchmark` clamps `samples` to
  20–300; `/api/condenser/adversary` clamps `budget` to 1–5 and `keep` to 0.05–0.9 —
  both modules document the upstream CLI as "stdlib only, runs in <1s–few seconds",
  but the API must enforce its own ceiling independent of caller-supplied values.
- **No stored XSS.** `compress()` echoes fragments of arbitrary user-submitted text
  back in `core_signal` / `structure` / `depth`. Every front-end page renders these
  fields with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, so reflected/stored markup in
  condensed text cannot execute as script.
- **No new write surface beyond what already existed.** The condenser API only adds
  one write path (`/api/condenser/compress` optionally saving a "star" to
  `data/condensers.db`, the same DB and method the bot already used standalone);
  benchmark and adversary endpoints are read-only computations and do not write to
  `data/`.

If you add a fourth condenser page later, follow the same pattern: wrap, don't modify;
gate through the existing `_gate()`; rate-limit any endpoint whose cost scales with
caller input; cap input size; render all dynamic text with `textContent`.
